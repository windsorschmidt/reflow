* Reflow Oven Controller

"Yeah man, but it's a **dry** heat!."_ â€”PFC William L. Hudson

* About

Hardware and firmware sources for a 2-channel reflow (toaster) oven
controller.

In spite of great alternatives such as [[http://www.whizoo.com/controleo3][Controleo3]], I decided to build
my own controller for personal use. The design is intended to be
simple and self-contained. Comments and pull requests are welcome!

* Hardware Features

- Two triac-controlled power outputs (no external SSRs needed)
- AC line zero-crossing detection for reduced switching noise
- Temperature sensor using MAX31855 K-type thermocouple amplifier
- Compact user interface with OLED display and Cherry MX key-switches
- Data-logging output though USB and serial-to-Bluetooth module
- Tone transducer for audible alerts (e.g. reflow cycle complete)
- Mounts in a dedicated enclosure for simple wiring using IEC connectors
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)][Aliens]] film inspired aesthetics

* Firmware Features

- Non-profiling PID routine controls triac outputs to track the active reflow profile
- Reflow profile can be viewed & edited at run-time (currently no ability to save edits)
